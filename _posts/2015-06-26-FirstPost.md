I've been meaning to start a blog for a while for a few reasons: <br>

1) Get a glimpse into world of front end development <br>
2) Track my progress on projects <br>
3) Learn by writing out problem solving methods <br>
4) Find out the appeal of this whole blog thingmerjig <br>
</br>

My focus for this blog will be on programming concepts, tools, and embedded systems.
<br> I hope you, dear reader, will join me on this haphazard journey.
