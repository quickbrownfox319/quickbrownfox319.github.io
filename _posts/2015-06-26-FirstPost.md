I've been meaning to start a blog for a while for a few reasons:

1. Get a glimpse into world of front end development
2. Track my progress on projects
3. Learn by writing out problem solving methods
4. Find out the appeal of this whole blog thingmerjig

My focus for this blog will be on programming concepts, tools, and embedded systems.
I hope you, dear reader, will join me on this haphazard journey.
