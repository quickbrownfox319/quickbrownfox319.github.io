Everything about coffee shops except the coffee.



## Cafe Enchante
### Coffee
I've only ever had the house coffee so far. It is pretty standard, as it's brewed before hand and then put into dispensers so there's no telling really how long they've been there. However, I do think there's enough traffic that it was always relatively fresh. There were a few times that it did run run out for the one I wanted. My medium cup of house ran about $2.65, which I think is expensive. They also do charge $1 for refills. Hot water refills for things like tea are also $0.60. They do have to make money back somehow.

### Food
Never had it here, but I do see a regular stream of people ordering from the menu for things like bagels and sandwiches. You do smell things like bacon every now and again even from the far end of the room.

### Location and Ambience
Cafe Enchante is all the way out in the Outer Richmond area on Geary Blvd. It's a charming coffee shop with plenty of seating, whether it's a large communal table or small intimate tables for getting shit done. It's cute, with murals of Parisian streets on the wall, lots of house plants, and an upright piano that you're probably expected to never touch. Light jazz music is played which wasn't too loud. There's plenty of outlets for charging, which is becoming more of a rarity in coffee shops. It is *cold* inside though, which doesn't help given that the Richmond is perpetually cold as is.

### WiFi
WiFi is pretty good here, with no noticeable drops in connection and a reasonably fast connection. Even with a dozen+ people inside there were never any hiccups. I probably would not recommend torrenting things here. Password is *notredame*. See how it still lends to the Parisian theme?

### Workability Rating
Lots of seating, lots of outlets, no *real* expectation of buying anything when you come in (though you should be nice and do it), good wifi. Negatives are for the lack of heat. Wouldn't kill to turn up the thermostat a tiny bit. I'd give this a 8/10.


## Peets Coffee on 10th & Mission St.
### Coffee
I wish I remembered but it was one of the cheapest things on the menu as I honestly just wanted a place to sit and camp out while working - probably the Peets equivalent of the house brew. If you've been to one Peets you've been to them all. Pricing was in the range of $2-3.

### Food
Your standard fare of Danish pastries and bagels. Didn't have any, but you can already visualize them in your head. They looked alright, but I probably wouldn't have bought any.

### Location and Ambience
It's located right next to the Big N tech companies such as Twitter, Uber, and Square so lots of young tech professionals around. However, it is also right next to Market St. near the Tenderloin area, meaning there are some homeless walking around, and it is kind of dirty. One of the large windows was broken and had a board put up in front of it. This place gets a lot of traffic as well, getting pretty busy. There are outlets however, and you will probably find a seat. It seems like some locals also like to visit the place and just hang out which is nice to me. The last thing you want is a coffee shop full of only tech bros and gals. Music was kind of loud as well, with your standard radio pop music playing.

### WiFi
WiFi was good. It did what I wanted such as searching StackOverflow and watching Youtube. No password required to log in. As always with public coffee shops, take some precaution on your internet safety.

### Workability Rating
Decent seating overall despite the numbers and outlets to boot. It was a bit dirty though, and tables were kind of rickety. I wouldn't feel safe leaving my laptop by itself for any period of time though. It was also a bit distracting with people always moving through it and loud music that I could hear through my earbuds. 5/10 overall.

## Coffee Cultures
### Coffee
Coffee is fancier (and more expensive). I yet again had the house coffee, which was called the Coffee of the Day. I did not ask what the coffee of the day was. Despite being one of the first here, it didn't seem the freshest cup somehow. I'll probably need to upgrade and try the more expensive drinks, though at $3.50 already, it's already pretty pricey for me to casually drink. A pour-over in comparison is $6.

### Food
Actually has a more extensive menu here such as ~avocado toast~, bagels, salads, etc. I had a toasted everything bagel with cream cheese. Standard coffee shop fare overall.

### Location and Ambience
Not too far from tech giants Twitter and Uber, this particular location is on the intersection of Mission and 9th St. Like the Peets, there are still some homeless around but it is a bit quieter and less busy, being further away from Market St. Ambience can be described as more hip, with indie music playing in the background. It is also a bit cold inside. Decent seating for the morning, though there's only either stool seating along the window, or some couches in the back to recline on. More for a casual meet up than a place to sit and work it feels like.

### WiFi
WiFi is pretty good, password protected SSID is *CoffeeCultureGuest* and password is *goldenstate*. There have been Yelp reviews of the internet being spotty here, but so far I have not experienced any of these.

### Workability Rating
I don't really like having my back to the bar counter where anyone waiting in line can look over my shoulder and see what I'm doing on my computer if I sit along the window, but there are really no other places to work. There are outlets however, which is always a plus. Coffee is okay, music isn't obnoxious. It is cold though, and can be busy. I'd give it an 6/10.
